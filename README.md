## Introduction

Motor imagery (MI) is a mental process of imagining a specific movement without performing it. EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) often rely on MI for control signals. This repository examines whether specific EEG channels are more critical for decoding MI signals and evaluates the performance of different channel selection strategies.

---

## Features

- Analysis of EEG signals from multiple MI datasets.
- Implementation of various channel selection strategies.
- Performance benchmarking with classification models.
- Visualization of channel importance and spatial patterns.
- Open and reproducible research workflows.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: EEG signals are preprocessed to remove noise and artifacts.
2. **Channel Selection**: Several methods for selecting specific EEG channels are implemented and compared.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Features are extracted from the selected channels using common spatial patterns (CSP) and other techniques.
4. **Classification**: Classifiers such as SVM and LDA are used to evaluate MI decoding performance.
5. **Evaluation**: Results are assessed using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
